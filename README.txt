JOE BIDEN STUBS HIS TOE AND GOES TO HELL
Copyright Aiden Trimble 2024

OVERVIEW
This was my final project for my retake of DAGD 155. The game was designed for my professor.
PROCESS

The bullet-based of the project, like the previous project, was meeting the requirements for a full grade. I also decided to challenge myself to make the entire game in a single weekend. It was simultaneously pretty fun and pretty “why did I do this to myself?”. The name came from just stringing a bunch of things together in my head and has no political meaning, but the whole time I was praying that Joe didn’t die during the semester, as that would have made everything really awkward. I also decided to try and include a melee weapon instead of the standard bullet-based weapons we were taught.

CHALLENGES  AND SOLUTIONS
The main challenge was the self imposed one I set where I designed the game in a single weekend. It was similar to a game jam where there was a lot of crunch, but also fun in a masochistic kind of way. The end product expected in this class wasn’t supposed to be very complex, which helped the game get finished within that timeframe.

REFLECTIONS
This project was very interesting as it allowed me to reflect upon how far I'd come from my first go at this class. My first final project was very rough and barely met the minimum requirements. It also took forever to put together as I wasn't very knowledgeable in what I was doing. One year later and now I'm able to crank out a game like this in a weekend. Now that I have a grasp on basic programming, I'm very excited to start moving on to actual game engines like Unreal and GameMaker.
